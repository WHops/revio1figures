# Downsampling figure
# Whoeps, 10th June 2024

This folder contains an R script to re-create the downsampling figures in the Revio1 paper. 

Input data is derived from the downsampling experiment, which in turn has its own repo and description here: 
https://github.com/WHops/lrs100_downsample

To create the figures, just run the R script as-is. :)
Final polishing was done in illustrator - raw pics and polished are both in /res.
